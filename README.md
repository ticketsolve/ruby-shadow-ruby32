## Ruby-shadow fork with Ruby 3.2 support

Fork of the [ruby-shadow](https://github.com/apalmblad/ruby-shadow) gem, with Ruby 3.2 support.

The original gem seems to be abandoned, so we've released this fork (and the corresponding gem on RubyGems), which contains the commit provided by a [fix PR](https://github.com/apalmblad/ruby-shadow/pull/31).

Note that this fork is not supported; its purpose is only to allow Ruby 3.2 users to continue using the original gem's functionality.
